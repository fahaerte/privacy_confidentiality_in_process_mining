Code for my master thesis "Privacy and Confidentiality mechanisms for Process Mining".

This repo was used to play around with various existing privacy-preserving Process Mining and Data Publishing techniques, exploring the state-of-the-art in research. 
In the end, only the code from SEPSIS_analysis/Sepsis_Analysis.ipynb was used.
