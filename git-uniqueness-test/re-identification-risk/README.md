# Quantifying the Re-identification Risk of Event Logs for Process Mining

The re-identification risk is quantified with measures for the individual uniqueness in event logs. 

Based on the approach presented in:
S. Nu√±ez von Voigt, S.A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen, D. Janssen, A. Koschmider, F. Tschorsch, F. Mannhardt, O. Landsiedel and M. Weidlich. Quantifying the Re-identification Risk of Event Logs for Process Mining. 


## Installation
### Clone
Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/d-o-m-i-n-i-k/re-identification-risk.git
### Requirements
- Python 3.5+
- Folder in working directory with the source data. Named 'datasets' by default.
- Folder where results will be written to. Named 'results' by default.

## Usage
### Step 1: Preparation of the data
Summarize all event data that occurs for the corresponding case. After conversion, each row in this data set belongs to one case. 
- Specify the path of the event log (csv) (default is set to subfolder 'datasets' of the current working-directory)
- Specify the name of the source-file
- Specify the unique identifier like CaseID, serial number etc.
- Specify a list of attributes to consider or a list of attributes to exclude
- The resulting list will be exported by default to a folder named after the dataset. 
The folder is a subfolder of 'results' in the working directory.

### Step 2: Calculate unicity 
Unicity is the number of cases that are uniquely identifiable by the set of case attributes or the set of event attributes.
In *unicity_activities.py* specify:
- the path for the event log (output of Step 1).
- the columnnames for the unique identifier, activities, timestamp, event and case attributes.
- the projection that should be considered.
Projection refer to a subset of attributes in the event log.
It is possible to specify the number of points as an absolute number or as a relative frequency.
The algorithm outputs the ratio of unique cases to the total number of cases.

### Step 3: Abstraction of the attributes
The re-identification risk can be minimized by generalizing the attributes.
With *timestamp_abstraction.py* the timestamps of the event logs can be abstracted, for example to remove the time.
